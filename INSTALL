This document will explain how to build and install the Pika library, interpreter and modules from source using the CMake build system.

---------------------------------------------------
** First Get CMake

(If CMake verison 2.6 or greater is already installed go to step 1.)
Go to the CMake home page at http://www.cmake.org and follow the instructions for installing CMake for your platform. If you are using a *nix platform if might be preferable to use the system's package manager.

** Now open up the terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

At the terminal type: 
note: (don't type the > character)

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake ../../pika
> make
> sudo make install

The first line creates a directory to house all the build files. This will keep the project and source directory clean. 

The second line invokes CMake at the projects root directory. You define constants for CMake using the -D option (for example '-DPCRE_PATH=/usr/include/'). CMake can also create project files for IDEs such as Xcode, Eclipse and Visual Studio by using the -G option (ie '-G Xcode' creates an Xcode project). Typing cmake --help will list all generators supported on your platform.

The third line builds Pika

The last line will install it
